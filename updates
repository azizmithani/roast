it contains changes directly in 14 july version, which is different from 25th july version
it incudes
	changes in CAP3 and RI module
	if after merging with cap3 contig total increase in length is < 50% of the read length drop that extension and marked this tag as LX and RX bases on side
	Don't create CAP3 of contigs with such tags in anyother iterations
	if contig and its CAP3 derivative are merging at RI step and again length doesn't meet above criteria
	in case of merging of this contig with any other contig remove this tag, it will be added next time automatically if again CAP3 generated contig for it.

######################
This version has cd-hit after every inner and outer iteration

#####################
-> This version has Number of Ns 5 for merging of CAP3 assemblies
-> filtering low quality mapping reads that may lead to uneven read numbers in bam file (which we have to fixed by picard may be) // stopped filtering option for the moment


#####################

-> replacing BLAT with local BLAST every where

#####################

-> filter distantly mapped reads code
-> change byRI.cpp for collecting RI and MI data 
-> main.cpp

#####################

For consensus sequence use botH CAP3 + my own script

#####################

mis-assembly chimera: change criteria to avoid exox-exon boundaries for start and end posotion at exteme corners

######################

added filter of mapping reads for missing sequence position

#####################

changed category of translocation to unsupported insertion for some cases

#####################

added check on size of header to avoid error at cufflink step due to long header ID 

#####################

added query size check in merging by SC to avoid merging of shorter seq than overlapTH

#####################

fixed bug in mis_assembly_chimera.cpp -> filterPOs_processFasta.

####################

fixed bug in R2 due to different strands for same contig for both BLASTs

####################

fixed bugs in misassemblies_chimera
-> float
-> 10 bases margin between two SCs pattern
-> coverage index adjustment

#####################

cdhitest input for all 

#####################

window size for gradual 200 , contig length > 600, loop end < read_length *3

#####################

Added BAM filter for hisat too

#####################

Filter secondary and supplementary alignments too in bam filter function

#####################

cdhitest options 0 1 2 for no, only in the start and for every iteration

#####################

bug fixed in mis-assembled_chiemera

#####################

BUg fixed for inversion

#####################

for criscross pattern of multigene chimera
SC_support_TH2 = SC_support_TH/2

for one-sided softclips for multigene chimera
SC_support_TH2 = SC_support_TH

##################### 14feb22

Base quality check using phred score for softclips
